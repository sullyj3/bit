# todo
- [ ] some indication of the end of the buffer (highlight differently?)
- [ ] refactor to disallow windows with no buffer
- [ ] turn the bar green in insert mode
- [ ] refactor eventhandlers to be pure AppState -> AppState functions
- [ ] highlight current line
- [ ] store filepath in Buffer
- [ ] redo cursor movement to interact with scrolling correctly
- [ ] show open file in status bar (and whether it's saved)
- [ ] saving back to same file
- [ ] saving to arbitrary location
- [ ] creating a new buffer
- [ ] I, a, A, o, O
- [ ] selection
- [ ] line numbers
- [ ] fuzzy finding of files
- [ ] command line
- [ ] investigate where I should put strictness annotations
- [ ] display tabs correctly
- [ ] load dhall settings file - provide expandTab, tabstop, shiftwidth, etc (or think about that design)
- [ ] handle long lines correctly
- [ ] map cursor position to buffer position
- [ ] deal correctly with characters of width > 1
- [ ] use a rope for each line (is this a terrible idea? lots of memory overhead. Maybe switch depending on line length)
- [ ] autoclose brackets
